        It was a challenge for me to learn
        ReactJs/Typescript/NodeJs/html/css/docker in a period of 10 days
        specially that I have zero knowledge in these technologies and I am full
        time employee so i had to do this after working hours and during the
        weekends.

        Hopefully I was able to cover what was requested from your side :)
